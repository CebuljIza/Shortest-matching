# Shortest-matching-in-.the-plane
Consider a set P of 2n points in the plane. A shortest matching for P is a set of segments with
minimum length such that each point of P is an endpoint of precisely one segment. Formulate
the problem as an ILP. 
Make experiments to find the expected value of total length of the shortest matching when the points 
are selected uniformly at random on the unit square, unit disk, triangle etc. Does the value 
increase or decrease when n grows? 
Consider the problem when the set of points consists of n red and n blue points and the matching has to use segments whose endpoints have different colors (bichromatic shortest matching). Compare the value of the monochromatic to the bichromatic solution.
